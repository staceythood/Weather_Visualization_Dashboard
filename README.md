## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot of latitude versus temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed and a means to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

- A landing page containing:
  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page.
- Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
- A "Comparisons" page that:
  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page to compare them visually.
  - Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
- A "Data" page that:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
